              "'The most powerful supercomputers on the planet are used to perform all manner of complex operations. Increasingly, they are used to enable artificial intelligence for research that could one day impact billions of people.\\n\\nThe world’s fastest and most powerful high-performance computing (HPC) supercomputers are front and center at the International Supercomputing Conference (ISC) which runs from May 29 to June 2 in Hamburg, Germany. As part of the ISC event, Nvidia will provide insight about its latest HPC systems and the use cases they enable.\\n\\n“HPC plus AI is really the transformational tool of scientific computing,” Dion Harris, lead technical product marketing manager for accelerated computing, said in a media briefing ahead of ISC. “We talk about exascale AI because we do believe that this is going to be one of the key pivotal tools to drive scientific innovation and any data center that’s building a supercomputer needs to understand how their system will perform from an AI standpoint.”\\n\\nU.S-based Grace Hopper superchip supercomputer coming to Los Alamos National Laboratory\\n\\nNvidia first announced its Grace ARM-based CPUs in April 2021, with a goal of including them in HPC deployments. The goal is now coming to fruition.\\n\\nAt ISC 2022, Nvidia is announcing that Los Alamos National Laboratory and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) are building Venado, which is the first U.S. based supercomputer to use the Grace chip architecture.\\n\\nThe Venado supercomputer uses a combination of Grace and Grace Hopper superchips, in a system that is expected to deliver 10 exaflops of AI performance. The Venado system will be used for material science, renewable energy, as well as energy distribution research.\\n\\nNvidia-powered AI enables brain imaging research\\n\\nBrain imaging is among the HPC and AI use cases Nvidia is announcing at ISC 2022.\\n\\nKing’s College of London is using the Nvidia powered Cambridge-1 system, which is the most powerful supercomputer in the United Kingdom, along with the open-source Monai AI framework that is optimized for medical imaging use cases.\\n\\nThe powerful hardware and AI software has been used to produce the world’s largest database of synthetic brain images.\\n\\nThe reason that is important is the amount of AI-driven research to identify conditions such as Alzheimer’s or dementia, Harris explained. “But in order to train those models, you need large databases,” he said.\\n\\nThere are many privacy concerns when using real patient data, which is why it’s important for researchers to have access to synthetic data, he added.\\n\\n“This is a true example of HPC not just delivering speeds and feeds, but really making real contributions to the scientific and research community,” Harris said.\\n\\nModeling a nuclear fusion reactor\\n\\nAs people around the world try to find solutions to the challenges of global warming, one of the primary strategies is to identify renewable energy sources.\\n\\nOne such source could be nuclear fusion reactors. Today’s nuclear reactors are fission-based and generate radioactive waste. The promise of fusion is that it can deliver large amounts of energy, without the same waste as fission.\\n\\nAt ISC 2022, Nvidia is announcing that the U.K. Atomic Energy Authority (AEA) is using the Nvidia Omniverse simulation platform to accelerate the design and development of a full-scale fusion reactor.\\n\\n“With the Nvidia Omniverse, researchers could potentially build a fully functioning digital twin of a reactor, helping ensure the most efficient designs are selected for construction,” Harris said.\\n\\nThe goal for Omniverse and the digital twin is to have an AI-generated replica of the fusion reactor system. The U.K. AEA is also planning to simulate the physics of the Fusion plasma containment itself. The simulation will be done with the Nvidia Modulus AI-physics framework to actually model how the fusion reaction and its containment can occur.\\n\\n“The holy grail of fusion energy is being able to not just create a fusion reaction, but have it be sustainable,” Harris said. “We really think this will be a path towards sustainable energy.”'"

CrowdStrike notified over a hundred victims, primarily from U.S. companies who unknowingly hired North Korean operatives,\\u201d Adam Meyers, head of counter adversary operations at CrowdStrike, told VentureBeat.\\n\\n\\u201cThese individuals infiltrate organizations, particularly in the tech sector, not to contribute but to funnel stolen funds directly into the regime\\u2019s weapons program,\\u201d Meyers said.\\n\\nNorth Korea seized an opportunity to exploit trust\\n\\n\\u201cThis surge in North Korean remote work schemes activity highlights how adversaries are exploiting the trust of our remote work environment,\\u201d notes Meyers in a recent VentureBeat interview.\\n\\nKnowing corporations have standardized on having their I.T. teams remote, and how public opinion in the U.S., Europe, Australia and on the Asian continent favors remote working, North Korea saw an opportunity to exploit the lack of verification and security to its advantage.\\n\\nSystematically targeting more than 100 companies to infiltrate with malicious insiders, and then screening members of an elite team of attackers to be part of the FAMOUS CHOLLIMA team to lead an insider attack is unprecedented. It signals a new era in cyber warfare and needs to be a wake-up call to any business doing remote hiring today.\\n\\n\\u201cAfter COVID, remote onboarding became the norm, and thus we\\u2019ve seen stolen identities being used to pass security checks and land jobs and then used to exfiltrate data or steal funds. Fifty percent of the cases CrowdStrike observed were used for data exfiltration. The processes created to facilitate remote work are being weaponized against us,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nAnatomy of North Korea\\u2019s insider threat attack\\n\\n\\u201cMany still underestimate North Korea\\u2019s cyber capabilities, dismissing them as a \\u2018hermit kingdom.\\u2019 But they\\u2019ve been investing in cyber talent since the late 1990s, with a strategic focus on STEM education from a young age. This recent sophisticated campaign shows that they\\u2019re not just a threat but a sophisticated adversary that we must take seriously. We\\u2019re only scratching the surface of their operations,\\u201d Meyers said.\\n\\nStarting in 2023, FAMOUS CHOLLIMA initially targeted 30 U.S.-based companies from aerospace, defense, retail and technology, claiming to be U.S. residents applying for remote IT positions. Once hired, attackers did minimal tasks related to their job role while attempting to exfiltrate data using Git, SharePoint and OneDrive.\\n\\nMalicious insiders were also quick to install Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tools, including RustDesk, AnyDesk, TinyPilot, VS Code Dev Tunnels and Google Chrome Remote Desktop to maintain persistence within the compromised network. After these tools were installed, they were able to use multiple IP addresses to connect to the victim\\u2019s system, appearing legitimate and blending into normal network activity. The malicious insiders could then execute commands, establish footholds and move laterally within a network without raising immediate alarms.\\n\\nCrowdStrike\\u2019s report found that organizations are seeing a 70% year-over-year increase in adversary use of RMM tools. RMM tool exploitation accounts for 27% of all hands-on-keyboard intrusions on endpoints. Nowhere was that more evident than in North Korea\\u2019s massive insider threat attack across more than 100 leading technology firms.\\n\\nIn April 2024, CrowdStrike Services responded to the first of several incidents in which FAMOUS CHOLLIMA malicious insiders targeted more than 30 U.S.-based companies. North Korean operatives claimed to be U.S. residents and were hired in early 2023 for multiple remote I.T. positions.\\n\\nMultiple investigations were in progress earlier this year into North Korean work schemes and fraud. By collaborating with broader ongoing investigations, CrowdStrike was able to identify FAMOUS CHOLLIMA insiders applying to or actively working at more than 100 unique companies, most of which were U.S.-based technology entities. The repeated detection of similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) across multiple incidents enabled CrowdStrike to identify a coordinated campaign.\\n\\nFBI, DOJ took swift action yet large-scale insider threats continue\\n\\nOn May 16 of this year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued an alert warning American businesses that\\u201d North Korea is evading U.S. and U.N. sanctions by targeting private companies to illicitly generate substantial revenue for the regime.\\u201d The Department of Justice (DoJ) took swift action against laptop farms FAMOUS CHOLLIMA had created through incentives to two Americans recently.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first indictment delivered on May 16 found that an Arizona woman had enabled North Korea to gain access to 300 IT firms. The second indictment was delivered on Aug. 8 to a man in Nashville, Tennessee, for running a laptop farm that enabled members of FAMOUS CHOLLIMA to work undetected for months, earning salaries paid directly into North Korea\\u2019s weapons program. The indictment warns of the global scope of the group\\u2019s operations, spanning seventeen nations and eleven industries.\\n\\n\\u201cLast week, the Justice Department arrested a Tennessee man accused of running a laptop farm scheme that helped North Korean I.T. workers secure remote jobs at Fortune 500 companies. This is consistent with activity that CrowdStrike has tracked as FAMOUS CHOLLIMA,\\u201d Meyers told VentureBeat.\",\n          \"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a foundational catalyst for digital business, according to a new report by Gartner. The last 10 years represent a breakthrough period in AI\\u2019s development, spurred by the convergence of factors including the rise of big data, advancements in compute infrastructure, new machine learning techniques, the emergence of cloud computing and the vibrant open-source ecosystem.\\n\\nIn evaluating the trends that will shape the future of AI in the enterprise, there are five trends that Gartner sees as being the most significant. Technology leaders must harness these emerging AI trends to democratize and foster its responsible use, adapt composite techniques, leverage AI for real-time analytics at the edge and exploit its generative powers.\\n\\nDemocratized AI will make AI accessible to a wide set of users. From uncovering unexpected opportunities by identifying trends hidden in large datasets, to augmenting and assisting workers in complementing their knowledge, democratized AI will touch every aspect of our lives.\\n\\nComposite AI is the ability to deploy a variety of AI techniques aligned with the right use cases. It brings the power of AI to a broader set of use cases and users, and it is gaining popularity because it improves AI\\u2019s versatility, efficiency and adaptability.\\n\\nEdge AI will enable digital moments by harnessing AI for real-time analytics closer to data sources. Gartner predicts that by 2025, more than 50% of all data analysis by deep neural networks will occur at the edge, up from less than 10% in 2021.\\n\\nResponsible AI is an umbrella term for making appropriate business and ethical choices when adopting AI. It requires considering business and societal value, risk, trust, transparency, fairness, bias mitigation, explainability, accountability, safety, privacy and regulatory compliance. Responsible AI is increasingly important amidst growing regulatory oversight, consumer expectations and emerging sustainability goals.\\n\\nGenerative AI is the use of AI to generate new artifacts and create groundbreaking products. To date, generative AI efforts have focused on creating media content such as photorealistic images of people and things, but it can also be used for code generation, creating synthetic tabular data and designing pharmaceuticals and materials with specific properties.\\n\\nRead the full report by Gartner.\",\n          \"Earlier this summer, the San Francisco-based AI startup Anthropic \\u2014 a leading rival of OpenAI when it comes to developing useful new large language models (LLMs) \\u2014 unveiled a surprise new feature it called \\u201cArtifacts.\\u201d\\n\\nThe feature allowed users of Anthropic\\u2019s Claude family of LLMs and chatbots on the web to enable a new window that would appear alongside their chat interface and run code snippets and even full programs generated by the LLM at the user\\u2019s request.\\n\\nFor example, a user could ask Claude to generate a simple interactive visualization, chart, or a playable game and run it alongside the chatbot right in their browser. The feature was impressive enough that VentureBeat editorial director Michael Nu\\u00f1ez called it \\u201cthis year\\u2019s most important AI feature\\u201d and users have since generated tens of millions of Artifacts since its release, according to Anthropic.\\n\\nHowever, users previously had to turn on Claude Artifacts manually by clicking their username initials in the lower left corner of the Claude chatbot screen, select \\u201cFeature Preview\\u201d and toggle on Artifacts. But no more: Anthropic today announced the general availability of Artifacts across its Free, Pro, and Team tiers, as well as its available on the official Claude iOS and Android mobile apps, making it easier to create and interact with interactive code on the go.\\n\\nAnthropic\\u2019s Head of Developer Relations Alex Albert posted on the social network X that he spent \\u201call morning replicating simple games with Claude. We\\u2019re nearing the era of mobile apps created in real-time by LLMs.\\u201d\\n\\nWe launched Artifacts on iOS and Android today!\\n\\n\\n\\nI've spent all morning replicating simple games with Claude.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe nearing the era of mobile apps created in real-time by LLMs. pic.twitter.com/ONSVzq9FKy \\u2014 Alex Albert (@alexalbert__) August 27, 2024\\n\\nOnly Free and Pro plans will have the ability to publish and remix Artifacts with the broader Claude community. This feature allows users to build upon and iterate on content created by others worldwide, facilitating a dynamic exchange of ideas and resources.\\n\\nFor users on the Team plan, Artifacts can be shared within Projects, enabling secure and efficient collaboration among team members.\\n\\nAnthropic expects Artifacts to streamline workflows and enhance productivity by allowing teams to use it collaboratively and iterate on one another\\u2019s creations securely over the web.\\n\\nThe strategy behind Claude Artifacts: user experience over raw power?\\n\\nWhile much of the AI development world has focused on enhancing raw processing power and expanding model capabilities, Artifacts represents a focus on user experience and redesigning AI interfaces away from the simple chatbot model.\\n\\nIn a way, I believe it is analogous to Nintendo in gaming \\u2014 the company often comes out with game consoles that have much less processing and graphics power than rivals at Microsoft and Sony, but seeks to gain users with novel user interfaces, often to great success.\\n\\nAnthropic envisions Artifacts as a versatile tool that can be utilized by teams across various industries to accelerate the creation of high-quality work products.\\n\\nThe platform supports a wide range of outputs, including code snippets, flowcharts, SVG graphics, websites, and interactive dashboards.\\n\\nFor instance, developers can now create architecture diagrams directly from their codebases, product managers can develop interactive prototypes for rapid feature testing, and designers can produce visualizations for quick prototyping. Similarly, marketers can design campaign dashboards rich with performance metrics, while sales teams can visualize their pipelines and forecast insights more effectively.\\n\\nAs Artifacts become a standard part of the Claude experience, Anthropic anticipates seeing a wide array of creative and practical uses emerge from its global user base.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "'The most powerful supercomputers on the planet are used to perform all manner of complex operations. Increasingly, they are used to enable artificial intelligence for research that could one day impact billions of people.\\n\\nThe world’s fastest and most powerful high-performance computing (HPC) supercomputers are front and center at the International Supercomputing Conference (ISC) which runs from May 29 to June 2 in Hamburg, Germany. As part of the ISC event, Nvidia will provide insight about its latest HPC systems and the use cases they enable.\\n\\n“HPC plus AI is really the transformational tool of scientific computing,” Dion Harris, lead technical product marketing manager for accelerated computing, said in a media briefing ahead of ISC. “We talk about exascale AI because we do believe that this is going to be one of the key pivotal tools to drive scientific innovation and any data center that’s building a supercomputer needs to understand how their system will perform from an AI standpoint.”\\n\\nU.S-based Grace Hopper superchip supercomputer coming to Los Alamos National Laboratory\\n\\nNvidia first announced its Grace ARM-based CPUs in April 2021, with a goal of including them in HPC deployments. The goal is now coming to fruition.\\n\\nAt ISC 2022, Nvidia is announcing that Los Alamos National Laboratory and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) are building Venado, which is the first U.S. based supercomputer to use the Grace chip architecture.\\n\\nThe Venado supercomputer uses a combination of Grace and Grace Hopper superchips, in a system that is expected to deliver 10 exaflops of AI performance. The Venado system will be used for material science, renewable energy, as well as energy distribution research.\\n\\nNvidia-powered AI enables brain imaging research\\n\\nBrain imaging is among the HPC and AI use cases Nvidia is announcing at ISC 2022.\\n\\nKing’s College of London is using the Nvidia powered Cambridge-1 system, which is the most powerful supercomputer in the United Kingdom, along with the open-source Monai AI framework that is optimized for medical imaging use cases.\\n\\nThe powerful hardware and AI software has been used to produce the world’s largest database of synthetic brain images.\\n\\nThe reason that is important is the amount of AI-driven research to identify conditions such as Alzheimer’s or dementia, Harris explained. “But in order to train those models, you need large databases,” he said.\\n\\nThere are many privacy concerns when using real patient data, which is why it’s important for researchers to have access to synthetic data, he added.\\n\\n“This is a true example of HPC not just delivering speeds and feeds, but really making real contributions to the scientific and research community,” Harris said.\\n\\nModeling a nuclear fusion reactor\\n\\nAs people around the world try to find solutions to the challenges of global warming, one of the primary strategies is to identify renewable energy sources.\\n\\nOne such source could be nuclear fusion reactors. Today’s nuclear reactors are fission-based and generate radioactive waste. The promise of fusion is that it can deliver large amounts of energy, without the same waste as fission.\\n\\nAt ISC 2022, Nvidia is announcing that the U.K. Atomic Energy Authority (AEA) is using the Nvidia Omniverse simulation platform to accelerate the design and development of a full-scale fusion reactor.\\n\\n“With the Nvidia Omniverse, researchers could potentially build a fully functioning digital twin of a reactor, helping ensure the most efficient designs are selected for construction,” Harris said.\\n\\nThe goal for Omniverse and the digital twin is to have an AI-generated replica of the fusion reactor system. The U.K. AEA is also planning to simulate the physics of the Fusion plasma containment itself. The simulation will be done with the Nvidia Modulus AI-physics framework to actually model how the fusion reaction and its containment can occur.\\n\\n“The holy grail of fusion energy is being able to not just create a fusion reaction, but have it be sustainable,” Harris said. “We really think this will be a path towards sustainable energy.”'"
