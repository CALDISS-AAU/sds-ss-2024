        "In this guide, we'll delve into leveraging open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) like Mistral, Llama, Gemma (and also Claude or GPT) and others for efficient Topic Modeling. Our focus will be on avoiding the exhaustive approach of processing each document with an LLM. We'll employ BERTopic, a flexible topic modeling framework that can utilize any LLM to refine topic delineations.\n",

The compatibility with the OpenAI format simplifies this process, allowing for a smooth integration. And later you can swap out for chatGPT or a local LLM.\n",

Through the OpenAI package, we will craft a request that aligns with the together.ai API specifications. This step includes defining the task, such as text classification or generation, and setting parameters like temperature for controlling the output's creativity.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Execution and Output Retrieval**: With the request formulated, we execute it via the OpenAI client, which communicates with the together.ai API backend. The backend, understanding the OpenAI format, efficiently processes our request using the specified Mixtral model.\n"
